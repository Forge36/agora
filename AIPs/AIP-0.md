## What is an Aergo Agora 

Aergo Agora is named after Agora, an open space that served as a meeting ground for various activities of the citizens in ancient Greek cities.

As you can learn from the name, Aergo Agora is the new on-chain governance system that aims to be a business-minded DAO and decentralised decision-making framework. Aergo token holders can participate and contribute in making governing decisions for the Aergo ecosystem through Aergo Agora. Aergo Agora will be accelerating Aergo to become a democratic, fully self-sustaining and open ecosystem. 

## Introduction of the Agora Steering committee 

To ensure we can implement this new model gradually and successfully, the Aergo Foundation will be introducing the Agora Steering Committee. The committee will focus on project screening and community voting seeding, to allow a more orderly and focused pipeline of ideas to be put forward. Members of the Agora Steering Committee will comprise, but not be limited to, Aergo’s existing leadership team and members from its very experienced advisory board as well as Blocko’s research and development team. 

## Aergo Agora execution plan in three phases 

- Phase 1(Q2 2020): Incubation period
    - The current staking framework for BP election will be extended in functionality to allow the community to vote on some broader topics, proposals and resolutions. Our current reporting processes (such as the QPU) will be transformed digitally, allowing the community to access the information in real time through the ledger residing on the Aergo blockchain.

- Phase 2(Q3 2020) : Maturity and Expansion.
    - More important pilot programs in selected areas, coupled with the formation of
the Agora Steering Committees for the Aergo ecosystem (aimed at screening and guiding the subsequent community). 

- Phase 3(Q4 2020) : Full launch 
    - As the incubation and maturation periods for Aergo Agora are completed, Aergo Agora will
be officially launched.
