# What is an Aergo Agora.

Aergo Agora is named after Agora, an open space that served as a meeting ground for various activities of the citizens in ancient Greek cities.

As you can learn from the name, Aergo Agora is the new on-chain governance system that aims to be a business-minded DAO and decentralised decision-making framework. Aergo token holders can participate and contribute in making governing decisions for the Aergo ecosystem through Aergo Agora. Aergo Agora will be accelerating Aergo to become a democratic, fully self-sustaining and open ecosystem. 

# Introduction of the Agora Steering committee.

To ensure we can implement this new model gradually and successfully, the Aergo Foundation will be introducing the Agora Steering Committee. The committee will focus on project screening and community voting seeding, to allow a more orderly and focused pipeline of ideas to be put forward. Members of the Agora Steering Committee will comprise, but not be limited to, Aergo’s existing leadership team and members from its very experienced advisory board as well as Blocko’s research and development team. 


# What is an AIP?

AIP stands for Aergo Improvement Proposal. All AIPs must be consistent with the goals of Agora (AIP-0). Currently there are three areas where AIP Authors can choose and suggest to make changes.

* **Argus** - For proposed changes to: Aergo tech development related matters
* **Dodona** - For proposed changes to: Aergo Ecosystem and marketing related matters
* **Agora** -For proposed changes to: Aergo Agora portal operation and policy related matters


# AIP Rationale 

We intended for AIPs to be the primary mechanisms when proposing changes to improve the Aergo Network on Aergo Agora. Aergo community members can track the progress of every stage of AIP implementation. 


# AIP Process and workflow 
The AIP process is a structured process for making changes to the Aergo Network. There are four parties involved in this process. 

* AIP Author 
* AIP Editor 
* Agora Steering Committee 
* Aergo Voters 

All AIP Authors who submit the proposal have to follow the template guidelines and follow each step of the workflow outlined in this document. The following is the process that a successful AIP moves along: 

* Stage I: Select AIP Track and submit a draft proposal
* Stage II: AIP editor review  
* Stage III: Agora Steering Committee review
* Stage IV: Aergo Community Vote 


# Status Terms

* **Draft** - an AIP that is undergoing rapid iteration and changes.
* **Accepted** - If such a decision is made from Aergo council, the EIP will move to Approved.
* **Approved** - An Aergo Foundation have decided to implement and release.
